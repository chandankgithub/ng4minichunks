This demo is to show the ngOnChanges call of child components.
Normally it invokes before ngOnInit but the obvious misconception is that whenever the child component changes it should invoke. But this is not the case.

This will ONLY be called when parent component changes the child component with @Input parameters.

Also, even parent component changes the child component's @Input parameter, this will not call ngOnChanges if only object property is changed. 
You need to replace the whole reference of the object.
